# Live Animal Habitat Video Feed Program
This is a Python program that simulates a live video feed from different animal habitats. Each habitat has its own unique ASCII art representation and a caption. The program utilizes the 'sync-input' module, which allows the program to wait for user input before continuing to execute.
